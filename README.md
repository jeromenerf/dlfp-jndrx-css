# JÃ©rome's DLFP CSS

Heavily based on 
[Bruno's spasibo CSS](http://linuxfr.org/users/pacifiko/journaux/une-nouvelle-feuille-de-style-orient%C3%A9e-lecture)

The original CSS is very nice, however, I prefer multi-column, fullscreen text
reading.

I also found the comments, quote or blockquote a bit difficult to distinguish.
